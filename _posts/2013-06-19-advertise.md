<p>Bitcoin Mining offers some of the highest quality traffic in the Bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency niche. To ensure sustainability we accept advertising and sponsorship.
<p>We are only interested in dealing with serious advertisers or sponsors who are willing to commit to a minimum $5,000 campaign paid in advance with bitcoins.
<p><h2>RATES</h2>
<p>We can be very flexible with whatever type of campaign you want to run. Almost all legal business will be considered although some niches will not. The site needs to be family friendly and professional.
<p><b>All advertising sponsorships must be paid in advance via Bitcoin.</b>
<p>Although spots can be custom tailored the rates will be similar to Coindesk:

<p><b>LARGE and LONG</b> - We prefer large and long deals to minimize administrative overhead.
<p>If you wanted to buy out the premier header banner spot (directly beneath the navigation bar and demoed on this page) for a 6 month period on both sites then we would probably do a deal for around $60,000.
<p>Talk about great exposure for your business!
<p><h2>CONTACT</h2>
<p>If you are serious about sponsoring with some advertising then please send a <a href="https://weusecoins-team.slack.com/">Slack message</a> with <b>(1)</b> what type of campaign you want to run, <b>(2)</b> where you would like the banners to appear and <b>(3)</b> your suggested rate.
<p>We are also willing to do a content partnership or some other creative option you may want to discuss. We are easy to work with and commercially reasonable.
